The DePaul Club Visa Bot
========================

The bot is part of the "`The DePaul Club <https://discord.gg/uJZghNMx>`_"
discord community which is a one-stop location for all your queries about
`DePaul University <https://www.depaul.edu>`_ as an International Student.

The bot aims to provide real-time updates of the current F-1 visa slot
availability in India. The data is pulled from the Telegram's famous `F1 Visa
Slot ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ <https://t.me/F1_Visa_Slots_Only>`_ channel which is then proxied to
Discord.

Workflow
-------

The bot fetches all the real-time updates asynchronously from the Telegram
users all over India, filters through the messages and forwards them to
the "*The DePaul Club*" discord server.

As many users contribute to the visa slot updates, there's a lot of noise and
inconsistency in the incomming messages. The bot filters only the messages which
start from `no vi` OR `vi avail` characters so that it can denoise the messages
and only provide updates which are seemed more relevant.  

Once it identifies a message which is good enough to be dispatched, the bot then
performs a `POST` request and posts message in the
`#slots-update <https://discord.com/channels/1037986077769740299/1038002223646515290>`_
channel.
